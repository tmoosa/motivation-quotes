# Motivational Quotes App

Welcome to the Motivational Quotes App! This is a simple React application that displays motivational quotes fetched from an external API. Get your daily dose of inspiration with just a click!

## Inspiration for Creating the App

Life can sometimes be challenging, and we all need a dose of motivation to keep pushing forward. The Motivational Quotes App was created with the intention of providing a quick and easy way to access uplifting quotes that can help brighten your day. Whether you're starting your morning, facing a tough task, or simply need a positive thought, this app is here to inspire and uplift you.

As the developer, I wanted to create a simple yet effective solution to deliver motivational content to users. By using an API to source quotes, this app ensures that you'll always have fresh and diverse inspiration at your fingertips. I hope that this app brings a bit of positivity and encouragement to your daily life.
